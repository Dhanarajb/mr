In my current role, I've played a key role in enhancing the user interface of our main product, drawing inspiration from user-friendly frameworks like Material UI to make it more accessible for application developers. Additionally, I've focused on optimizing the compatibility of our components for seamless functionality across various devices, particularly emphasizing mobile responsiveness for improved accessibility on phones and tablets. This work is particularly significant within the healthcare domain, where the components I've contributed to can be utilized for medical machines, ensuring a smoother and more effective user experience.

#### Can you provide an example of a challenging technical problem you encountered and how you resolved it during your tenure?
Sure! When working on Edison Design System 2.0, we had a problem with how fast things were working. It was a bit slow. So, to make it better, we used some smart techniques called memoization and virtual DOM enhancements. This made the web component work much faster and smoother. We also spent a lot of time testing and fixing any issues, making sure it's easy for other developers to use in their projects.

#### Can you discuss a challenging project or Deadline you've worked on and how you overcame obstacles as a front-end developer?
Absolutely! I once worked on a really challenging project with tight deadlines. To tackle it, I made sure to concentrate on the most crucial tasks first, collaborating closely with my team. We had regular discussions to make sure everyone was on the same page. If there were any problems or obstacles, I made sure to speak up early so that we could find solutions together. We adjusted our plans as needed, managed our time efficiently, and, in the end, successfully completed the project within the given deadlines.

#### Can you tell me about how you worked on projects in your last job?
Certainly! In my previous role at Tech Mahindra, we followed the Agile methodology, specifically Scrum. We had regular team meetings such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. These meetings were essential for effective communication and quick decision-making. Collaborating within diverse teams ensured that everyone had a clear understanding of our project objectives. This approach allowed us to work efficiently, adapt to changes swiftly, and successfully deliver our projects.

#### CI CD
 I've been involved in Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). I write and develop code while using Git for version control. Automated testing ensures that my code works correctly. A Continuous Integration server automates the build and testing processes. We store our build artifacts in a repository. I've designed and executed deployment pipelines for continuous delivery, progressing from staging to production. Automated deployment processes reduce errors during releases. Monitoring tools help track application performance in production. Regular reviews and improvements are made to optimize our CI/CD processes. Overall, my experience involves a streamlined and efficient approach to software delivery.s

 #### redux -ttolkit
 Redux Toolkit is like a helper for managing data in React apps. It makes things easier by reducing extra code and providing tools to organize data changes. You can create a store with less setup using configureStore, handle actions and data changes more conveniently with createSlice, and deal with asynchronous operations in a simpler way. It works well with the Redux DevTools Extension, making it easier to debug. With Redux Toolkit, updating and getting data from the app's memory is made more straightforward, improving how we manage information in our React applications.

#### How do you decide what work to do first in a project?
When planning our work for a project, I think about what is most important for the project and what the client needs. I look at things like what depends on something else, how hard a task is, and if there are any possible problems. This way, we can do the most important things early, making sure we finish the project on time. I talk a lot with my team to make sure we all agree on what's most important.
